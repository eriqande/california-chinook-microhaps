	\footnotesize Negative log base 10 of association $p$-values for
	individual SNPs for late-fall versus fall run.  $x$ axis shows position in genome (in megabases),
	with color alternating by chromosome, as indicated by numbers above the $x$-axis. ``Unk'' refers
	to unplaced scaffolds in the Otsh\_v1.0 genome assembly \citep{christensen2018chinook}. The 
	upper panel is the comparison between late-fall and Feather River Hatchery fall, while the lower 
	panel is the comparison of late-fall to San Joaquin River fall.
