# ToDo:

Let's be expedient:

- DONE! ~Basic pop-gen summaries, means +- 2 SD.  See if AC has this already.~
  * Numbers of alleles 
  * Average (over loci) heterozygosity (observed and expected)
  * Average (over loci) Sample Size
  * Proportion of polymorphic loci 


- RoSA analyses --- keep them separate for the GSI (show how similar FRH and TRH F/S are),
  and then we show how we can identify at least the spring in the FRH.  


- Working the LFAR in there.  There was something weird on one of the plates
  that Cassie ran where the LFAR didn't quite work.  


- Break the Eel and Russian into their own reporting units?
