# Introduction

Anthony ran these analyses by using the reference data set and running them
in the program Structure using the our lab's [slg_pipe](https://github.com/eriqande/slg_pipe)
framework for parallelization.  

Subsequently, outputs were uploaded to the [CLUMPAK server](https://clumpak.tau.ac.il/) for
visualization.



# Session Info

```{r}
sessioninfo::session_info()
```


# Running Time

Running the code and rendering this notebook required approximately this much time:

```{r}
Sys.time() - start_time
```
